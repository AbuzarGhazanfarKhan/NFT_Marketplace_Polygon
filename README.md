# About This Project
This will be NFT Marketplace - an NFT marketplace:
When a user puts an NFT for sale, the ownership of the item will be transferred from the creator to the marketplace contract.

When a user purchases an NFT, the purchase price will be transferred from the buyer to the seller and the item will be transferred from the marketplace to the buyer.

The marketplace owner will be able to set a listing fee. This fee will be taken from the seller and transferred to the contract owner upon completion of any sale, enabling the owner of the marketplace to earn recurring revenue from any sale transacted in the marketplace.

### This Project will be deployed on Polygon matic

## Transfers ownership of the item, as well as funds between parties
  
```solidity

  function createMarketSale(
      uint256 tokenId
      ) public payable {
      uint price = idToMarketItem[tokenId].price;
      address seller = idToMarketItem[tokenId].seller;
      require(msg.value == price, "Please submit the asking price in order to complete the purchase");
      idToMarketItem[tokenId].owner = payable(msg.sender);
      idToMarketItem[tokenId].sold = true;
      idToMarketItem[tokenId].seller = payable(address(0));
      _itemsSold.increment();
      _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);
      payable(owner).transfer(listingPrice);
      payable(seller).transfer(msg.value);
    }
